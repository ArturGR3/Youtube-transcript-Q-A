0.24,5.76,two days ago open AI released swarm now
3.439,5.28,what it is is a educational framework
6.0,5.48,for developers and it's about building
8.719,4.8,multi-agent workflows what we're going
11.48,4.159,to do today is we're going to come up to
13.519,4.161,the code and click on clone and bring it
15.639,3.881,down to the computer after that we'll
17.68,3.679,look through some of the documentation
19.52,4.72,see how it works look at a little bit of
21.359,4.961,code and finally we're going to go
24.24,4.279,through the examples so they've got a
26.32,4.359,bunch of examples available inside the
28.519,4.24,codebase and we'll test them out on the
30.679,4.88,system I'm happy Dave please like And
32.759,5.361,subscribe let's get into it the Swarm
35.559,4.68,project is focusing on execution and
38.12,5.08,coordination and it has two different
40.239,4.721,concepts within it one is called agents
43.2,3.72,and the other is handoffs and with
44.96,4.919,agents what we're looking at are
46.92,5.04,instructions and tools with the handoffs
49.879,4.36,if we go over to the document related to
51.96,4.96,this there's a cookbook orchestrating
54.239,5.361,agents routines and handoffs and it's
56.92,5.2,defined as an agent that hands off
59.6,5.16,process accessing to another agent now
62.12,4.84,the swamp project is essentially an area
64.76,4.039,to explore patterns the patterns for
66.96,4.519,lightweight scalable and highly
68.799,4.921,customizable Design This is not a
71.479,5.241,replacement for crew AI or other sorts
73.72,5.36,of Frameworks like that as yet and it's
76.72,4.84,more about educating developers on how
79.08,5.44,they can work with large language models
81.56,4.72,in a workflow and step oriented system
84.52,3.919,but to get started let's come to the top
86.28,5.24,here we're going to click on code and in
88.439,4.96,this case I'm going to use GitHub CLI
91.52,5.559,and I've just created a folder called
93.399,8.241,test and we're going to paste in GH repo
97.079,6.761,clone open AI swarm and let it come down
101.64,4.0,now the repository with the examples are
103.84,3.599,on the computer but what we'll do is
105.64,3.6,we'll come here and we'll click on the
107.439,3.921,install command and coming back to the
109.24,4.28,terminal we'll just paste in that
111.36,5.16,command and make sure it's in now I've
113.52,4.919,opened up the repository here in vs code
116.52,4.0,and we should check out a few things if
118.439,3.801,we open up the Swarm directory you'll
120.52,3.72,see that there's a little bit of code
122.24,4.96,going on in the system and we'll check
124.24,4.48,some of that out later if needed there's
127.2,4.0,examples and we're definitely going to
128.72,4.4,be working through here but it's the
131.2,4.399,assets we start with so if we go and
133.12,4.119,look at the Swarm diagram you can see
135.599,4.961,what's the weather in New York and
137.239,6.201,that's being sent to a triage assistant
140.56,5.6,and its job is to go well what is the
143.44,5.2,question coming in and hand it off to
146.16,6.48,the correct agent in this case it's the
148.64,6.679,we assistant and says it's 67° in New
152.64,5.879,York now if we come back and look at the
155.319,5.081,examples there's already a weather agent
158.519,4.321,system that we can go and look at if we
160.4,4.88,look at the read me file it says this
162.84,4.6,example is a we agent demonstrating
165.28,4.0,function calling with a single agent so
167.44,3.439,very similar to what we just now getting
169.28,4.039,started when you look at this file
170.879,5.161,there's the import of the agent from
173.319,4.521,swarm and then there's two functions
176.04,4.279,going on and we can see that these
177.84,5.36,functions are being put put into an
180.319,4.84,array on the functions property of the
183.2,4.72,agent and we'll look a bit later as to
185.159,4.64,how this is actually running but let's
187.92,4.239,have a look at some of the documentation
189.799,4.761,related so I've put together this image
192.159,5.121,that shows that it's initiating the
194.56,4.959,Weber agent and then it's delegating to
197.28,4.48,the get Weber request and some input
199.519,4.961,parameters need to come through to that
201.76,4.64,the location and the time from that it
204.48,3.959,should be able to retrieve the we data
206.4,3.399,now this is mock data that comes through
208.439,4.121,in the system but this is where you
209.799,4.16,would put call to an API and then after
212.56,3.879,that it's returned the wether
213.959,5.441,information and it can then do other
216.439,5.601,tasks such as sending an email and if
219.4,4.839,you provide the correct email details
222.04,4.399,the goal would be that it sends an email
224.239,4.761,now further into the documentation what
226.439,4.681,the main starting point is is an agent
229.0,4.0,and it just has a system prompt or an
231.12,4.119,instruction called you are a helpful
233.0,4.48,agent and the only other thing it knows
235.239,4.56,about is that it's got two functions
237.48,5.16,that it can delegate responsibility to
239.799,5.121,the get Weber and the send email so when
242.64,4.08,we look at those functions we'll see
244.92,4.72,that the get we is get the current we in
246.72,5.12,a given location M location must be a
249.64,5.08,city and that's listed and there's also
251.84,5.359,a time and this by at the moment when we
254.72,4.4,look at the functions we default to now
257.199,3.72,the goal of this is to return some sort
259.12,3.799,of Json structure that has the
260.919,5.0,information we need there's also an
262.919,5.441,additional function going on called send
265.919,4.641,email with that it takes a recipient
268.36,4.64,subject and body and we'll see how well
270.56,4.68,that works so let's work out how we're
273.0,6.199,going to run this so it's pretty simple
275.24,6.44,it says here Python 3 run py now what is
279.199,5.521,that so we're currently looking at code
281.68,6.32,from the agents py there's also this run
284.72,6.08,py and it's taking the we agent that
288.0,4.36,we've just defined right here and
290.8,4.28,putting it through to something called
292.36,5.88,run demo Loop so what is that so if we
295.08,6.76,come down to the Swarm area we have this
298.24,5.28,file called reple dopy and within that
301.84,5.12,we've got the ability to process and
303.52,6.28,print the streaming responses we can do
306.96,6.0,pretty messages but the main Loop that's
309.8,5.399,going on is sitting here so the incoming
312.96,4.679,agent in this case we agent would come
315.199,5.961,in through here and it would get passed
317.639,5.161,in to the client. run in the agent
321.16,3.96,variable and the agent variable is just
322.8,4.399,being loaded there so I've got the code
325.12,4.639,open but we've come into terminal and
327.199,5.481,what we'll do is we'll CD into the
329.759,5.801,examples Weber agent folder from there
332.68,5.28,we should be able to do the Python 3 uh
335.56,4.88,run.py and see what we get the first
337.96,6.72,thing it's saying is who is the user and
340.44,5.96,I say I might just say hi I'm appy Dave
344.68,4.519,and we'll see what it comes up with
346.4,7.4,hello appy Dave how can I assist you
349.199,7.0,today uh what is the temperature can't
353.8,4.64,spell I think in
356.199,4.241,Sydney and we'll see what it comes up
358.44,3.96,with so it's calling a function called
360.44,6.319,get weather and it says the current
362.4,6.0,temperature in Sydney is 65° F now when
366.759,5.241,we look at the code we can see that
368.4,5.639,that's hardcoded into the system so if
372.0,4.08,you want this to return a real value you
374.039,4.44,would go and change this line so that
376.08,4.88,it's calling some sort of API to get the
378.479,4.921,current weather for the location and
380.96,4.679,time but let's move on to the next one
383.4,4.32,so this is sending an email to a
385.639,5.4,recipient and there's three parameters
387.72,5.16,going on who is it to subject and body
391.039,4.56,let's see how this works now we're back
392.88,7.52,at the terminal and I'm going to say can
395.599,7.481,you send email to Davida dave.com and
400.4,5.48,see what it comes up with it said could
403.08,6.48,you please provide the subject and body
405.88,5.719,of the email subject is hot today it's
409.56,5.32,come back with this message the email
411.599,5.921,has been sent to David at ave.com with
414.88,5.159,the subject what is hot and the body
417.52,4.84,agent workflow Builder is hot day the
420.039,4.361,agent workflow Builder is a software
422.36,3.92,application that I'm building in public
424.4,4.359,moment so I'm demonstrating the code as
426.28,4.8,it goes and it's basically around
428.759,3.801,designing agent workflows like the ones
431.08,3.839,we're working with right now with the
432.56,4.96,wether agent complete let's close that
434.919,4.361,down and we'll move on to the triage
437.52,4.28,agent now if we go and look at the
439.28,5.639,readme file first we can see this is an
441.8,5.679,example of a swarm with a triage agent
444.919,5.601,takes user inputs it can respond
447.479,5.881,directly or it can triage and send to
450.52,4.48,other agents like the sales and refund
453.36,4.399,it says that we can run it from the
455.0,4.4,command line using Python 3 run if we
457.759,4.481,look at that we'll see that it's using
459.4,5.799,that same run demo Loop example we saw
462.24,5.639,earlier if we go into the code we'll see
465.199,5.12,that we've got a couple of handoff
467.879,4.6,functions we've got three different
470.319,4.44,agents going on some more handoff
472.479,4.201,functions let's have a look at that
474.759,4.12,documentation here we've got this
476.68,5.919,example of the Swarm containing triage
478.879,5.88,agent will take inputs from the user and
482.599,4.081,decide what to do including sending it
484.759,5.321,to the sales and refund so we can see
486.68,5.4,the triage agent going on here it
490.08,4.76,understands what the request type is and
492.08,5.04,will send it to one of these two agents
494.84,4.079,now from this point the agents have
497.12,4.4,their own logic that they can do they
498.919,6.201,can proceed with doing a sale they can
501.52,5.119,apply uh discounts or do refunds so
505.12,3.96,there's a bunch of things going on in
506.639,4.161,here now if we look at it from this
509.08,4.56,document ation point of view there's the
510.8,4.919,main agent and the instructions are
513.64,4.319,determine which agent is best suited to
515.719,4.44,handle the user's request and transfer
517.959,5.161,the conversation and who can it transfer
520.159,6.081,to a handoff function called transfer to
523.12,4.76,sales and one called transfer to refund
526.24,4.12,so after that you can see there's a few
527.88,4.519,functions going on here and some of them
530.36,4.28,return messages like this a message
532.399,4.961,indicating success of the refund another
534.64,5.36,one message indicating that the discount
537.36,4.52,was applied but some of the others will
540.0,4.0,just send information back to a
541.88,4.8,different agent so this one just comes
544.0,5.6,back to itself or we can send it off to
546.68,5.12,the sales agent or the refunds agent so
549.6,4.52,when we look at the sales agent it's got
551.8,4.96,a main system instruction called be
554.12,4.839,super enthusiastic about selling bees
556.76,4.68,now if it can't handle the question
558.959,5.0,coming in its only job is to go back to
561.44,5.56,the triage agent a bit further on we've
563.959,5.241,got the refunds agent and the main
567.0,4.48,instruction for the refund agent is help
569.2,5.36,the user with a refund if the reason was
571.48,5.88,too expensive offer the user a re refund
574.56,4.92,code if they insist then process the
577.36,4.52,refund we've got two different handoff
579.48,5.56,functions going on processing and
581.88,5.199,applying discounts and otherwise let's
585.04,3.64,go back to the triage with this one as
587.079,4.0,well let's go and have a look at a bit
588.68,3.96,of code we've got a couple of functions
591.079,4.401,going on here we'll come back to them in
592.64,5.8,a moment because the next area is there
595.48,5.96,are three agents being defined now the
598.44,5.92,first agent with a name and instructions
601.44,5.639,is going to control the whole process
604.36,4.44,from that it has a sales agent we can
607.079,4.641,work with and one of the things that the
608.8,5.599,refunds agent can do is delegate
611.72,5.28,responsibility to handoffs so we got the
614.399,4.761,process refund and the applied discount
617.0,4.92,and we can see that information going on
619.16,5.96,here now if we come back to the sales
621.92,5.12,agent and we go be super enthusiastic
625.12,3.159,about selling bees and I think that
627.04,3.6,might be the first thing that we can
628.279,5.0,just play around with and change before
630.64,6.24,we run the AG what we'll do is change
633.279,5.521,bees to we're selling agent workflow
636.88,4.04,Builder this is the application that I'm
638.8,4.8,building in public around designing
640.92,4.88,these sorts of workflows now the next
643.6,5.08,thing we've got is help the users with a
645.8,6.12,refund if the reason is that it's too
648.68,5.64,expensive offer the user a refund code
651.92,5.52,well why don't we change that to a
654.32,5.68,discount code we'll call it AWB Early
657.44,4.959,Access after that we've got a couple
660.0,4.639,more handoff functions that we can call
662.399,4.961,and they're being linked up to the
664.639,4.64,triage agent right here now after that
667.36,3.8,we've got a final set of handoff
669.279,4.481,functions so if we think of the first
671.16,5.32,two handoff functions as being used by
673.76,5.28,the refunds agent here then what these
676.48,5.24,ones offer is the transfer back to
679.04,5.16,triage is available to both the sales
681.72,5.2,and refund agent whereas the triage
684.2,5.8,agent can send things to either the
686.92,5.32,sales or the refunds agent so I've just
690.0,3.92,come down to terminal we're in swarm I
692.24,3.599,think I'm just going to paste in agent
693.92,4.159,workflow Builder see what it comes up
695.839,4.041,with it says it looks like you're
698.079,4.961,interested in building a workflow for
699.88,7.519,agents that's exactly true I might just
703.04,7.12,say can I get a discount that would be
707.399,4.44,great so it's thinking at the moment it
710.16,4.44,says could you please let me know the
711.839,6.961,reason you're looking for a discount uh
714.6,9.359,I can offer you a discount code of AWB
718.8,11.76,early access that sounds good I want the
723.959,9.12,AWB Early Access can you apply it I've
730.56,5.959,successfully applied the discount using
733.079,6.88,the code AWB Early Access it's added to
736.519,10.241,your cart saving you $100 so let's see
739.959,9.44,if we can buy it and I would like to buy
746.76,5.079,awbb and it says great choice the
749.399,5.401,purchase of agent workflow Builder you
751.839,7.521,can proceed to the cart with the
754.8,6.52,discount already applied by it I wonder
759.36,4.279,whether this is actually going to work
761.32,4.56,so it says it looks like you're ready to
763.639,5.721,make a purchase I'll transfer you back
765.88,7.44,to our triage agent so we'll assume it's
769.36,7.039,uh done what I'll say is I have bought
773.32,5.0,when will you ship and it's just come
776.399,3.88,back with for inquiries related to
778.32,5.12,shipping and Order delivery let me
780.279,4.8,transfer you to our sales consultant so
783.44,3.88,I think we'll go into a bit of a loop if
785.079,4.641,we keep doing this but that's the tree
787.32,4.319,arge and we've had multiple agents
789.72,4.479,working together we've been able to go
791.639,5.241,back to the master agent we've been able
794.199,5.08,to go back to the triage agent we've
796.88,5.079,been able to go from the refund agent to
799.279,5.281,the sales agent and this is a pretty
801.959,4.24,interesting workflow so let's go back to
804.56,5.32,the code and see what we just went
806.199,5.481,through we came in using the tri agent
809.88,4.319,and from that I asked for a discount so
811.68,4.719,that took us over to the discount agent
814.199,4.601,that I've put here we saw both of those
816.399,4.88,function handoffs called so we got the
818.8,5.36,process discount the apply discount and
821.279,5.321,you can see it said discounting item
824.16,4.479,because and it had some sort of reason
826.6,4.76,and then it said applying a discount it
828.639,4.721,said applied $100 to your card now at
831.36,3.839,that point I also had a couple of issues
833.36,3.919,getting back to the sales agent and when
835.199,4.76,I came back and looked at the code it
837.279,4.721,made complete sense why it happened and
839.959,4.761,the reason for that is that the discount
842.0,5.56,agent currently has three areas it can
844.72,5.119,go to it can process a discount it can
847.56,5.199,apply a discount the only other area it
849.839,4.601,can do down here is go back to triage so
852.759,3.721,the next step would have been to go back
854.44,4.72,to the operator the triage and from
856.48,4.799,there move on to the sales so all up
859.16,4.919,this is an incredible little workflow
861.279,5.0,and really quite simple so we' finished
864.079,5.361,the Weber bot that was fairly simple
866.279,5.081,we've moved on and done the triage s and
869.44,5.28,refund bot that's a little bit more
871.36,5.719,complex let's see what's next so if we
874.72,4.679,minimize this file and we go over to the
877.079,4.0,support bot we can see that there's a
879.399,3.961,fair bit more going on there's a
881.079,4.481,requirements text going on we've got a
883.36,5.2,Docker container looks like we've got a
885.56,5.079,bunch of articles in the form of Json
888.56,4.12,documents now what I want to do is see
890.639,4.32,if I can get this up and running so
892.68,5.2,we've got the user interface agent and
894.959,4.601,The Help Center agent and there's a
897.88,4.199,bunch of things that we got got to do
899.56,5.48,I've already run the making so let's
902.079,5.32,just get Docker composer up we'll start
905.04,5.039,that it's running so we come over to
907.399,5.44,prep data we've got some imports we've
910.079,5.361,got an embedding model we're querying
912.839,5.12,through articles that's the Jason
915.44,4.04,documents and we're running and
917.959,4.0,embedding this against them so we're
919.48,7.24,getting the vector data from this and
921.959,7.521,storing it into QD rant client and what
926.72,4.84,else have we got going on here
929.48,5.0,if the collection exists delete it
931.56,6.32,otherwise create the collection and then
934.48,5.24,upsert the data let's see if this works
937.88,4.6,so I ran this a couple times and I got a
939.72,5.16,few errors but one of the things I tried
942.48,5.599,was just trying to hit the collections
944.88,5.319,here I believe the data is in so let's
948.079,4.2,just see if I can get this working so
950.199,4.241,we'll come over to our documentation and
952.279,4.721,we've got this new concept called the
954.44,4.56,support bot this is an example of a
957.0,4.56,customer service bot which includes a
959.0,5.959,user interface agent and a help center
961.56,5.56,agent so they're represented here help
964.959,5.721,center agent can query documents submit
967.12,5.48,a ticket send an email and transfer to
970.68,4.079,The Help Center agent which is itself
972.6,4.039,I'm assuming so there must be other sub
974.759,3.76,agents going on here and then we got the
976.639,5.44,support agent also querying dots
978.519,6.521,submitting tickets and sending an email
982.079,5.041,so the idea of the support agent is to
985.04,4.719,handle interactions with the user called
987.12,5.399,for General uh support issues that
989.759,5.0,aren't handled by other agents can query
992.519,5.161,the documentation submit a ticket and
994.759,5.32,send an email if we move on down to the
997.68,5.04,Health Center agent we got this deals
1000.079,5.841,with questions about open AI agents such
1002.72,6.64,as GPT models dully and Whisper so we'll
1005.92,6.0,ask questions of that later so let's
1009.36,4.599,give it a work so I think we'll use it
1011.92,4.599,before looking at the code this time I'm
1013.959,4.44,just going to say I'm David and see what
1016.519,4.921,it comes up with could you please
1018.399,7.4,provide more context or specify a query
1021.44,10.879,related to David well I would um like to
1025.799,9.16,know the time in Chang my Thailand which
1032.319,3.52,is currently where I'm living so Chang
1034.959,4.0,my
1035.839,5.921,Thailand and hopefully that uses a
1038.959,5.761,general sort of Bot the local time in
1041.76,6.0,changai Thailand is current 7 hours
1044.72,6.04,ahead of coordinated universal time or
1047.76,6.44,UTC please check your local time to add
1050.76,4.88,time differences well that's great can I
1054.2,7.4,ask
1055.64,8.159,questions about chat GPT or open AI it
1061.6,8.88,should have documents related to them
1063.799,9.521,how do I write a prompt for DOL 3 it
1070.48,5.36,says creating a prompt for doly 3 the AI
1073.32,6.04,model designed to generate images from
1075.84,6.68,test descriptions involves clear clear
1079.36,5.439,and descriptive help so we've got B
1082.52,8.6,specific clear language include style
1084.799,8.76,and medium Etc okay how do I make an API
1091.12,6.88,call to the
1093.559,6.201,completions API for chat and we've had a
1098.0,3.919,whole lot of information come through
1099.76,5.6,set up your environment pip install
1101.919,6.361,requests obtain an API call write your
1105.36,4.72,API calls now what are we working with
1108.28,5.36,we're working with the user interface
1110.08,5.599,agent in this case so I'm not sure
1113.64,3.919,whether a second agent has come into
1115.679,3.961,play I reckon we should have a look at
1117.559,5.801,the code now so I've come over to the
1119.64,7.6,main Pi file here we've got query the
1123.36,5.36,vector store we've got query docs and
1127.24,4.52,then we've got a couple of handoff
1128.72,5.64,functions send email submit ticket and
1131.76,4.84,transfer to The Help Center then the
1134.36,4.92,user interface agent which was where I
1136.6,5.0,was at so that wasn't doing anything
1139.28,4.759,to communicate with the database from
1141.6,4.84,what I can tell and if we look at the
1144.039,5.361,help center agent which is where we need
1146.44,5.719,to be this is where we can query docs
1149.4,4.72,submit a ticket or send an email maybe
1152.159,4.321,let's try and get to The Help Center
1154.12,6.28,agent we're back at our chat client so
1156.48,5.12,we'll say transfer me to The Help Center
1160.4,4.279,I don't know whether I need the word
1161.6,4.92,agent I probably shouldn't need it and
1164.679,4.721,let's see if that changes so now we're
1166.52,5.08,on a help center agent seem that
1169.4,4.48,transfer function is not available at
1171.6,7.559,the current stage however I can assist
1173.88,10.88,you with issues directly Can I submit a
1179.159,7.64,ticket around errors with Vector store
1184.76,4.039,which was what I was dealing with
1186.799,4.281,earlier so the main thing I'm trying to
1188.799,4.561,do is see whether the submission ticket
1191.08,6.12,system works says your ticket regarding
1193.36,6.12,errors has been successfully entered um
1197.2,3.4,can I search
1199.48,5.439,for
1200.6,8.84,articles on open ai will'll go with the
1204.919,6.361,voice API see what it says searching for
1209.44,4.719,knowledge
1211.28,4.84,retrieving so it looks like it worked if
1214.159,3.961,we just grab this searching knowledge
1216.12,4.76,base for query and we do a search in
1218.12,5.2,here we can see it popping up open AI
1220.88,7.039,voice API and it's come up with some
1223.32,7.44,information let's just go back to main
1227.919,7.961,agent see what happens we're still with
1230.76,9.08,the help center agent let's go back to
1235.88,7.6,user interface agent see if we can go
1239.84,5.319,back that far and we can't that's okay
1243.48,4.0,and exit won't do anything I don't
1245.159,4.64,believe have a great day it gives us a
1247.48,3.92,message so that's pretty cool so I did
1249.799,4.041,have a couple of configuration issues
1251.4,4.72,with the support bot but did get it up
1253.84,4.16,and running uh things like the personal
1256.12,5.64,shopper and customer service I didn't
1258.0,5.919,use but let's have a look at basic and
1261.76,4.08,we've got these little scripts that you
1263.919,4.081,can run we'll just move a couple of them
1265.84,4.64,into Focus so you can see what's going
1268.0,4.72,on and the last one's called function
1270.48,4.28,calling believe we can run them all one
1272.72,3.76,at a time so looking at these
1274.76,3.96,individually they're just simple scripts
1276.48,4.72,we got the agent handoff where we've got
1278.72,5.559,English and Spanish and one of the
1281.2,7.44,things going on is there's a transfer to
1284.279,6.4,Spanish being called by the English
1288.64,4.639,agent so if we come down here and type
1290.679,6.201,in agent handoff and run it let's see
1293.279,6.441,what we get that's coming through hola I
1296.88,5.48,don't know how to say Spanish let's move
1299.72,5.559,on to the next one so we've got bare
1302.36,6.199,minimum so let's go Python and we'll
1305.279,6.321,type in bare minimum and what do we got
1308.559,5.521,here how can I assist you today so
1311.6,4.6,that's really all it's saying we can see
1314.08,4.0,that the function calling is just an
1316.2,4.2,agent that's helpful and it will
1318.08,4.4,delegate responsibility to a function
1320.4,5.68,and the function will just return some
1322.48,7.4,Json data if we run that the weather in
1326.08,6.199,New York is currently 67° F this is
1329.88,5.6,great let's just move into this last one
1332.279,5.121,called contest variables so we got this
1335.48,4.36,context variables here and there's two
1337.4,4.6,key value pairs so let's change one of
1339.84,4.28,them we'll go name is appid Dave and
1342.0,5.76,user ID is
1344.12,5.2,555 and what happens is we've got this
1347.76,4.68,instructions coming through and
1349.32,5.479,instructions now is not a stream instead
1352.44,5.88,it's a function and it's taking in the
1354.799,6.081,context variables so we can grab the
1358.32,5.4,user which should be appy Dave you are a
1360.88,5.72,helpful agent greet the user by name it
1363.72,4.8,should be appy day and if I'm
1366.6,4.4,understanding this correctly we're just
1368.52,4.84,going to run two different responses
1371.0,4.76,sequentially so the first one should be
1373.36,4.919,a greeting the next one should be the
1375.76,5.399,Account Details so let's hit save on
1378.279,6.081,that we'll come over to here and we'll
1381.159,5.52,run the context variables script hello
1384.36,5.76,AB Dave how can I assist you today
1386.679,6.0,Account Details ABY day 555 so that's
1390.12,5.52,open ai's lightweight multi-agent
1392.679,6.641,framework called swarm it's experimental
1395.64,6.56,"at the moment 4,900 Stars actually let's"
1399.32,6.359,just refresh that it's already gone to
1402.2,6.44,"5,100 Stars since I started recording"
1405.679,5.201,this about two hours ago so the next
1408.64,5.519,video I'm going to do is hooking up my
1410.88,5.08,agent workflow Builder into swarm so
1414.159,4.441,that I can automate the stuff that I
1415.96,5.76,usually do manually so this is a
1418.6,4.84,workflow that I'll use very soon to
1421.72,2.959,publish this video we'll work through
1423.44,3.479,the script we'll work through the
1424.679,4.041,thumbnails stuff like I'm happy Dave
1426.919,5.481,please like And subscribe and I'll see
1428.72,3.68,you in the next video
