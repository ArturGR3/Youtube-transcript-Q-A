6.219,1.061,Thank you everybody.
10.989,2.09,"Well, thank you very much. It's an honor and"
13.85,1.349,"they told me, uh"
15.619,3.6,"under no circumstances, are you allowed to use a teleprompter?"
19.229,2.83,And I got up here and I see this is beautiful teleprompter.
22.639,1.121,So here I am.
24.44,1.859,But uh it is
26.479,0.01,a
26.85,3.66,tremendous thing. It's a tremendous dinner. I've come here with my father.
30.709,3.781,"So it was three times, but it was also many times before that a"
34.84,2.68,long time ago. And it's a very special dinner
38.0,3.439,and you've done a fantastic job. Cardinal. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
44.389,1.43,"So, I'd like to thank"
46.639,4.511,"your eminence very much. And members of the clergy, so many"
51.419,0.88,people I know
53.43,3.41,"Speaker of the House Johnson, what a job you're doing."
58.63,1.599,"He has done a great job,"
61.689,1.86,Senator Schumer. Good.
63.88,3.789,"I supported him. I was, oh, I don't know. I don't know."
67.91,1.32,He used to say that's true.
69.239,2.96,"And now I'm not sure he would, but I, I gave him his first check"
72.55,1.799,from an office in Beach Haven
75.66,2.14,and uh I was very proud of it.
77.94,1.22,I don't know about it lately.
80.839,4.9,"Now I was, I was, it was his first check. He was running and I said he's a good man."
86.239,4.021,"Uh, Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much. Thank you very much for"
90.519,1.12,"working hard,"
94.059,0.78,"Governor Hoco,"
95.33,4.28,wherever you may be up. This is a big day is right. Where is the governor?
101.489,0.65,Good job.
102.779,1.6,"It's not an easy one, is it?"
105.19,1.199,But you're doing all right.
106.4,3.04,We have to get a little money from the federal government. I have to tell you.
109.65,1.919,"It's about, it's about time,"
111.989,1.85,it's about time. Mayor Adams.
114.04,1.9,Good luck with everything. They went after you.
117.5,1.58,They went after you. Mayor.
120.76,1.619,"Oh, boy, I do that"
123.47,1.32,9.5 months ago.
124.8,3.479,"I said, and he just said something about it about the administration."
128.49,2.11,He's going to be indicted any moment
132.11,2.979,and guess what happened? But you're gonna win. I think you're gonna win.
135.1,1.959,I know you're gonna win. So good luck.
137.559,0.931,Good luck.
139.429,1.49,I don't like what they do.
141.49,1.48,I don't like what they do
143.729,3.44,"and also distinguished because so many friends up here, it's, uh, great,"
147.179,1.011,not a great friend.
148.199,0.47,"Some, uh,"
148.779,1.48,some of my best friends
150.789,3.451,and you are right. They are distinguished and they are wealthy for the most part.
154.25,1.71,"A couple are having a hard time, but"
156.149,1.121,they're going to get over it.
159.179,3.96,I also want to thank my very beautiful wife and thank you for mentioning.
163.149,2.171,But can you believe this? She did a book
165.729,2.341,and it's a really good book and she worked hard on it
168.539,4.14,and it just became number one in the New York Times list. So I think that's ok.
176.889,1.441,"That's not an easy thing to do,"
178.339,3.3,especially when your name is Trump and you're on the New York Times list.
181.649,0.03,I
181.8,0.75,think that thing
182.869,1.83,that must be selling like hot cakes.
185.07,2.75,But thank you so much. I appreciate the job you did.
188.63,2.289,It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening.
191.059,1.17,Amazing pleasure.
192.61,2.429,"And uh, these days it's uh"
195.52,2.72,really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a
198.589,2.011,subpoena for my appearance.
203.619,3.02,"Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy"
208.05,2.149,"they've gone after me, Mr Mayor,"
211.38,2.399,your peanuts compared to what they've done to me
214.88,1.48,and you're gonna be OK.
217.539,1.621,"But I have to be careful however,"
219.169,4.51,to understand that this will be the first time in the history of this event
224.139,3.54,where jokes will be fact checked and they will be
228.309,1.381,and they will be. It's been a
229.88,3.269,long tradition for both Democrat and Republican
233.839,3.481,candidates for president of the United States to attend this dinner.
237.47,2.97,"Always, it's a rule. You gotta go to the dinner,"
240.889,4.461,you gotta do it. Otherwise bad things are gonna happen to you from up there. I
245.46,0.04,"was,"
247.71,2.29,"you can't do what I just saw on that screen,"
250.66,3.89,"but uh my opponent feels like she does not have to be here,"
254.559,2.321,which is deeply disrespectful
257.339,2.821,to the event and in particular to our great
260.6,2.639,"Catholic community, very disrespectful."
268.69,1.359,The last Democrat
270.799,3.03,not to attend this important event was Walter Mondale
274.41,2.399,and it did not go very well for him.
277.7,3.139,He lost 49 states and he won one.
281.269,0.85,Minnesota.
283.269,0.03,Yes.
284.51,1.84,So I said there's no way I'm missing it.
286.359,2.51,"Actually, it was not easy for me to get here tonight"
289.79,0.139,because
290.079,3.651,I wasn't gonna miss this thing no matter. I didn't care.
294.38,4.229,I wasn't gonna miss it. But that's true. Walter Mondale 49 and one
298.809,1.68,he was expected to do well
301.39,1.259,and it didn't work out.
305.529,3.701,"It shows you there is a God. I mean, for those people that are questioning it,"
311.48,3.19,I understand the real reason that she's not here. She's
314.92,3.539,"hunting with her running mate, spending a lot of time hunting"
320.369,4.47,"in any event. It, a weird, weird, weird, weird. You know the word weird."
325.64,4.96,They called me weird. They called JD Weird. We're very solid people.
330.709,2.991,This guy is calling us weird. But this was weird that
334.089,3.31,the democrat candidate is not here with us tonight.
337.739,2.961,I want to also congratulate somebody's gonna make us all
341.059,4.791,healthy. RFK junior. We love you. I don't see if he's campaigning all over the place.
346.41,1.399,He's campaigning. He
347.92,1.319,"was, you're all over?"
349.47,2.739,How? Hello? You both. Nice to see you both
352.5,2.54,doing a good job. He's a great guy too. He really is.
355.049,2.22,He's gonna make us a healthier place.
357.279,1.361,We're gonna let him go wild for a little
358.649,1.87,while then I'm gonna have to maybe rein him back
362.309,4.011,because he's got some pretty wild ideas. But most of them are really good. I think
368.209,1.78,"he's a, he's a good man"
370.179,1.85,and he believes he believes
372.51,3.74,"the environment, the healthy people. He wants healthy people."
376.26,1.15,He wants healthy food
377.94,3.69,and he's going to do it. He's going to have a big chance to do it because we do need that.
382.35,3.609,I would not have missed the Al Smith dinner for anything in the world.
385.97,1.75,I still remember coming here
388.19,4.38,"as a very young guy with my father, Fred. He was a great guy."
392.579,4.361,"My father, he was a, he was a tough cookie, but he had a very big heart."
397.22,3.889,He was anytime we'd walk down the street and you don't see it too much anymore.
401.119,2.69,"There'd be people standing with tin cans,"
404.269,4.06,tin cans and he would always take out $100 and put it in that can.
408.649,2.741,"And I always thought it was beautiful and frankly,"
411.529,3.9,"I even think more so now it was beautiful because nowadays you don't see it so much,"
415.829,2.611,but I miss him and we used to come here
418.64,1.58,very religiously.
420.69,0.94,"And, uh,"
422.44,2.619,a great New York tradition has been
425.309,4.071,born 79 years ago. It was born 79 years ago. And
429.559,2.101,there are some people that were here for
432.109,3.871,almost at length. I know many of them and it's not a pretty picture.
436.44,1.1,It's not a pretty picture.
438.42,4.93,"The two candidates for president are supposed to exchange good natured Barbs and,"
443.359,1.63,"you know, we get along very well."
445.609,3.16,"I didn't like Biden very much and now I like him quite a bit, you know,"
450.869,1.03,and now I say that
453.26,3.699,she is much worse than him. He was a much better candidate than her actually.
457.779,2.81,"And when we hopefully win dispose of her,"
461.14,3.689,"I like her a lot. But right now I can't stand her. It's true. I can't stand,"
465.41,2.48,I've never liked people that I was competing against
469.1,1.269,"when you do. Uh, a"
470.67,2.509,lot of bad things happen and we are doing well.
473.19,1.649,"By the way, the votes are starting to come in."
474.85,2.949,"You got to get out and vote and Catholics, you got to vote for me."
478.429,2.66,Just remember. You better remember I'm here
481.269,2.301,"and she's not, I could have done that too,"
485.04,1.91,but you do something that's incredible.
486.959,1.931,The Catholic church is helping the poor
488.899,3.31,educating Children and supporting the vulnerable.
493.179,3.731,"But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation,"
496.92,2.919,"I guess you should have told her the funds,"
500.769,3.01,we're going to bail out the looters and riders
503.79,2.66,in Minneapolis and she would have been here guaranteed.
506.459,0.81,She would have been here
508.73,1.02,guaranteed.
511.85,2.889,She would have been ok. She would have been ok with that.
515.46,4.04,"But I know this isn't my normal crowd tonight because it just isn't,"
519.51,1.64,it's not my normal crowd.
521.69,1.609,"Believe me, my normal crowd"
524.08,0.86,"is younger,"
526.46,1.779,"has a lot more energy,"
529.609,2.021,but you have certain advantages too.
532.59,1.819,"Like cash, lots of cash."
535.549,3.951,But many of you are Manhattan liberals from the media and the Democrat Party.
539.94,2.979,"I always say the Democrat, you know, Chuck doesn't like that."
542.929,4.531,"He likes Democratic and it sounds much more beautiful. The Democratic Party,"
547.7,2.8,I always say the Democrat Party because it sounds worse.
553.39,4.05,It is true. He likes Democratic. Why don't they just change the name this way?
557.679,1.721,"You know, they, it is Democrat."
559.929,4.5,"But, uh, I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was"
564.58,4.039,skipping the Al Smith dinner. I'd really hope that she would come because we
568.83,3.81,can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. She laughs like crazy.
573.32,3.18,We would recognize it any place in this room and
576.739,3.63,all polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote
580.95,1.339,as I should be
582.75,1.07,as I should be.
585.13,4.409,But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. She hasn't instead of attending tonight.
590.0,3.94,She's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer.
599.13,1.489,That's not a pretty sight.
601.869,4.721,"But Catholics, please don't be too insulted by Kamala's absence."
607.039,1.93,"If the Democrats,"
609.08,0.26,he
609.539,0.26,"says,"
609.9,1.93,thank you very much. I appreciate that.
612.739,4.101,"If democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening,"
616.849,2.01,they would have just sent Joe Biden.
621.849,2.52,"You know, he's having second thoughts, you know that right?"
624.38,1.729,"He's having, he wants to come back."
626.989,2.86,"If she does any worse in the polls, they're gonna bring him back again."
629.859,2.671,"I think Chuck, he's gonna do it. He's the one that got him out."
633.27,0.969,That's the guy.
635.179,2.961,"Much more so than crazy, Nancy. I will tell you"
638.32,1.799,"because I know him, he did it."
641.239,3.31,Joe has almost disappeared from view. The only way he could
645.21,3.579,"be seen less as if he had a show on CNN. They had nothing,"
649.469,1.121,they've got nothing
651.369,1.821,fake news. Right? Fake.
654.979,3.74,"That term wasn't good. You know, they say the term is no longer in vogue"
659.179,3.06,because it's much worse than fake. I don't want to tell you what the real name is.
662.25,0.729,I won't do it
663.169,2.95,because all those cameras would shut off immediately. They don't like that.
666.13,3.63,But apparently Joe didn't think it was fair for me to have the podium
670.26,2.5,to myself with Kamala skipping the event.
673.809,1.1,"So he called,"
675.69,1.099,looked at me
676.969,0.89,"and said,"
678.19,0.799,"don't,"
680.19,1.719,"does anybody understand that? Yes,"
683.21,0.759,"that was,"
684.419,2.39,I thought it was actually very good until just now
688.039,1.801,it was announced this morning that at a
689.849,2.88,"funeral yesterday in a rare moment of clarity,"
693.469,0.27,Joo
694.059,1.5,"Barack Hussein Obama,"
695.989,0.851,they quote
698.76,1.719,only a few people got that
702.51,5.25,"or as Rush Limbaugh used to say Barack Hussein Obama, remember"
708.219,1.991,he was a piece of work. We miss him.
712.109,4.2,"But as he told Barack Hussein Obama quote, she's not as strong as me."
716.32,2.33,She's not as strong. Do you understand that?
719.34,3.069,"And Obama agreed saying that's true. Other than that,"
722.679,2.841,"I think the Democrats are getting along quite well,"
726.309,2.211,"right. They get, nobody got that one."
729.429,1.261,The fact is
731.14,2.39,we need new leadership in this country right now.
733.539,2.591,We have someone in the White House who can barely
736.489,0.8,"talk,"
738.02,2.969,barely put together two coherent sentences
741.28,1.449,who seems to have
743.02,0.99,mental
745.869,2.19,faculties of a child has said
748.46,2.139,there's a person that has nothing going
750.96,2.139,no intelligence whatsoever. But
753.52,1.06,enough about
754.869,2.55,"Kamala Harris, let's get on to something."
758.71,4.089,I know Kamala's word because she spends a lot of time complaining I won't
763.69,1.52,agree to another debate.
765.82,2.359,"But the truth is, I've debated twice this year,"
768.19,3.64,once against Joe Biden and once against David Muir of ABC.
773.719,1.871,That was amazing. 11 times.
776.44,3.4,None for the other side. Do you think that's fair news? I don't think so.
779.849,1.21,That's fake news.
781.179,2.591,I don't know what's going to happen. Three weeks from now.
784.45,3.0,"It's gonna be, uh, very interesting. It just started."
788.169,1.37,"It's actually, uh,"
790.34,2.209,"it's actually, isn't it sort of exciting?"
792.94,2.969,"Right. It really, isn't it just exciting? What's going on?"
796.39,2.44,It's a process. It's a rough process too.
799.109,1.2,Not so pretty
800.75,2.0,and yet sometimes very beautiful.
803.159,4.301,But the press is reporting that Democrats are starting to panic.
808.32,0.96,They're panicking.
809.289,3.33,"They are panicking because you know the votes that are coming and are coming in very,"
812.63,1.349,very strong in a certain way.
813.989,1.721,"I won't tell you what way that is, but"
816.07,2.029,Chuck Schumer is here looking
818.469,1.221,very glum.
820.83,2.49,"This, it looks lovely. It looks love"
825.669,3.5,but look on the bright side check considering how woke
829.28,1.529,your party has become.
831.26,4.37,"If Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president."
840.669,2.3,"And I actually I said, do you mind if I do that?"
843.45,3.63,"And he said, no, you gotta do what you gotta do. He's a pro, he's a profession."
848.15,3.5,"No, he's, he's a good man. Actually, I hate to say it."
853.4,1.74,"Don't ever use it against me, please."
855.15,2.93,They'll say this dinner was really set me back when I say that.
858.09,1.529,But I've known him a long time.
860.179,2.3,There's a group called white dudes for Harris.
862.489,3.281,Have you seen this white dudes for Harris? Anybody know it?
865.78,2.939,"Are some of you here, white dudes for? It doesn't sound like it,"
869.469,2.421,but I'm not worried about them at all because
872.099,4.5,"their wives and their wives, lovers are all voting for me."
879.65,2.18,Every one of those people is running.
883.34,4.24,And as you may have seen Kamala did an interview on Fox News yesterday.
888.2,1.8,It went so poorly
890.4,2.639,for her that the democrats have been forced to
893.479,3.521,install another 100 drop boxes throughout the city.
899.09,3.219,And the upside really is Kamala now sees the benefit of
903.479,3.12,deportation. She wants to deport people. She's vicious.
906.609,2.93,She wants to deport people and she wants to start by
909.78,1.019,deporting Bret Bayer
910.95,0.82,Fox.
913.01,2.13,It's an interesting interview last night. A
915.7,4.359,major issue in this race is childcare and Kamala has put forward a
920.229,1.87,concept of a plan.
922.489,1.37,A lot of people don't like it.
923.869,4.581,The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be
929.07,1.82,not to let her husband doug
931.45,2.37,anywhere near the nanny. Just keep them away.
934.809,1.581,That's a nasty one.
936.95,1.229,That's nasty.
938.45,3.06,I told these idiots that gave me this stuff. That's too tough.
943.64,3.39,"Oh, I did, I did. You know, they told me the last time I did this,"
948.159,2.46,"uh, I was running against crooked Hillary"
951.19,0.479,and
952.53,0.899,"I mean, Hillary."
954.39,3.86,"No, I was running against crooked Hillary and I did it and I thought it was a roast."
958.26,1.649,So I was told it's a roast.
960.239,3.531,And I had the meanest guy you've ever seen write stuff up. And
964.33,2.019,man was the room angry.
966.5,1.929,Even the Cardinal remembers
968.59,3.18,I went overboard. Don't you agree? Card? It was like terrible.
972.309,2.941,"And I knew I was in trouble around midway through because, you know,"
975.26,2.599,people are not even my own side was angry at me.
977.869,1.54,They were saying it's too much.
979.95,2.81,But uh I did it anyway. I didn't give it.
985.53,3.41,Campaigning could take a toll on a family and family life.
988.95,2.599,Although I hear that Kamala and her husband
992.53,2.98,carve out some really beautiful alone time at the
995.52,1.889,"end of the day for an intimate dinner,"
997.419,1.89,just dug her
999.77,2.409,and the teleprompter that she uses quite well.
1003.33,0.7,"And by the way,"
1004.039,3.77,she wouldn't have liked this tonight if she was told about no teleprompter.
1007.82,1.95,I can't believe I saw a teleprompter.
1009.969,3.281,They said they've never had a teleprompter in the history of
1013.44,0.83,this dinner.
1014.71,1.589,"I told that to the condo, right?"
1016.51,1.32,And then a teleprompter
1018.299,4.161,"pops up for, he must be a very important comedian to get that."
1023.09,2.82,They give you one but not me. How about that one? Come
1026.04,0.029,in?
1026.92,1.269,And you did a good job.
1029.118,2.812,Tradition halls that I'm supposed to tell a few
1032.65,0.49,self
1033.25,1.848,deprecating jokes this evening.
1035.449,1.38,So here it goes.
1038.26,0.608,"Nope,"
1039.319,1.091,I've got nothing
1041.848,0.6,I that now
1044.03,0.9,there's nothing to say.
1048.42,1.98,I guess I just don't see the point of
1050.41,3.309,taking shots at myself when other people have been
1054.01,2.699,"shooting at me for a hell of a long time. And they shoot,"
1057.969,2.62,"you know, they say about presidents, they say that"
1060.89,1.179,Andrew Jackson
1062.209,1.061,was the
1063.619,4.511,"president. That was the most meanly treated his wife died, she died of heartache."
1068.77,2.299,She was heartbroken at the way they treated him.
1071.75,4.5,"And they say that second was Abraham Lincoln, but he was in charge of"
1076.369,1.801,"a civil war. You know, so,"
1078.319,2.111,but those were the two Andrew Jackson
1080.77,2.919,"up until me. Now, they say it's not even close."
1083.699,3.27,There's never been a president that's been treated so badly
1087.4,2.809,"as me and our people aren't happy about it,"
1090.5,2.109,"but I was treated a little bit rough,"
1093.199,4.361,but I don't mind it somehow and I think it's uh just part of the game.
1097.8,4.909,"I'd like to thank our MC this evening, Jim Gaffigan most recently,"
1102.719,1.26,Jim has been playing
1104.15,2.1,"Tim Wilson, Saturday Night Live"
1106.78,3.36,"and that'll be a very short gig. I hope Jim,"
1111.469,2.14,"but it was fun while it lasted, wasn't it?"
1114.75,1.53,"Let's see how that lasts, right."
1116.43,4.96,"It better be quick. We don't want him and, you know, I'm not gonna say anymore."
1121.869,4.36,"But unfortunately Governor Walsh is in here himself, but don't worry, he'll"
1126.56,1.97,"say that he was, he's gonna say,"
1131.959,5.101,I used to think that democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods.
1137.619,0.87,But then
1138.8,1.38,I met Tim Waltz.
1142.479,2.12,The stupid show. The view
1144.969,0.791,is so bad.
1145.77,3.74,"Now that the other day I was watching it and thinking to myself, you know what,"
1149.729,1.6,they really need to bring
1151.63,1.63,Rosie o'donnell back.
1154.359,2.6,That show is bad. Those people are bad.
1157.39,3.599,I know every one of them and they are bad news. I want to tell you
1162.209,1.61,and it doesn't do very well either.
1163.829,3.201,"I always like to say, you know, ratings are very important when they don't do well,"
1167.04,1.23,it doesn't do very well
1168.92,2.14,"as I look around the day, as I see"
1171.329,3.171,"all of the usual suspects, for instance, Mayor Adams,"
1174.819,1.861,"I'd like to poke some fun at Eric,"
1177.01,3.17,but I'm going to be nice. I just want to be nice because I know
1180.31,5.34,what it's like to be persecuted by the Doj for speaking out against open borders.
1186.15,4.089,"We were persecuted, Eric. I was persecuted. And so, are you Eric?"
1191.089,2.721,The mayor's dietary restrictions are well known.
1193.819,2.601,But I've got to say I've never met a person
1197.0,2.369,who's a vegan who like turkey so much.
1200.42,1.38,There's something about him with Turkey.
1201.81,3.19,"I just found that out today and I haven't been in New York that much,"
1206.689,2.42,"but don't let it back. You're gonna win, Derek."
1209.839,2.98,"We have another former New York City mayor with us, frankly,"
1213.77,1.579,easily the worst
1215.75,0.9,in our history.
1218.65,1.91,And it's not Michael that I can tell you.
1222.17,1.26,I'm surprised that
1224.28,2.6,Bill De Blasio was actually able to make it tonight.
1226.89,5.49,"To be honest, he was a terrible mayor. I don't give a shit if this is comedy or not."
1232.479,1.76,He was a terrible mayor.
1234.76,3.66,"He did a horrible, he did a horrible job."
1239.06,2.32,"That's not comedy, by the way. That's fact."
1242.17,2.0,"But unlike the rest of New York, at least,"
1244.18,2.96,Bill doesn't have to worry about the criminals.
1247.459,1.25,They owe him big.
1249.53,2.579,He let them get away with a lot of stuff.
1252.4,3.669,"Well, I'd better wrap up because Mayor Adams told me earlier that I"
1256.319,2.931,needed to make this one very quick. Especially
1259.55,2.669,the city has reserved this room for a large
1262.229,2.831,group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas.
1265.819,0.52,That's right.
1266.349,4.661,"They've reserved many rooms, many rooms, a lot of rooms, too many rooms."
1271.06,3.95,"But in all seriousness, it's an honor to be here to support the city and"
1275.65,2.819,the community. It's a great community that I love.
1278.479,2.031,I've been here a long time and I love it
1280.859,3.38,"and then it's gonna make a big comeback and I'm gonna help it, make a comeback."
1284.25,3.599,I'm gonna win and I'm gonna make a comeback. We're gonna turn this thing around
1291.3,3.939,and I want to pay tribute to a really incredible man. A man who
1295.54,4.47,"was a tremendous politician. And actually the fact that he was Catholic was,"
1300.329,4.311,"it probably did him in, right. It probably, nobody knows for sure."
1305.14,5.339,"But, uh, he was a great guy. Al Smith, great guy. Everyone says it. Happy Warrior."
1310.819,1.321,"I've said before that,"
1312.31,1.129,I'll say it again.
1313.449,4.111,"I'll say it again as many times as I have to, directly to the mayor and"
1317.689,1.451,the governor. If I have
1319.319,1.28,the honor to be
1321.229,0.96,elected
1322.38,3.949,"next month, we're gonna see what happens. It's happening so fast. But"
1326.579,0.86,"if I have the honor,"
1327.449,3.24,I look forward to working together to make this city greater than ever before.
1330.699,0.831,We're gonna do that.
1331.819,3.181,"We're gonna be, we're gonna be focused on, I'll work with the governor."
1335.76,2.709,I'll work with the mayor Democrats. I will work with them.
1338.479,2.041,I work with whoever I have to and we will even
1340.53,3.329,work very hard to bring back the salt tax deduction.
1343.869,1.031,We're gonna bring it back.
1345.459,1.341,We're gonna bring it back.
1348.01,2.42,We're gonna get that thing going. Chuck. Ok.
1350.959,2.461,I actually thought about not
1353.589,3.12,"doing jokes tonight. I was going to come out here and say, listen,"
1357.239,3.161,our country is doing very badly. This is not about jokes.
1360.849,3.781,"And then some person said you have to do jokes. I said, I don't want to,"
1364.819,2.711,there's nothing funny about what's happening to our country
1367.8,3.059,"and I actually meant that I was going to do that, but they convinced me"
1371.25,0.939,to
1372.39,3.839,"say some of the things I said tonight. I don't know if they were funny or not. But,"
1376.479,0.6,"uh,"
1377.469,2.541,"hey, you think this is easy standing up here and do"
1380.939,3.93,this in front of half a room that hates my guts and the other half loves me.
1386.439,4.821,"Half of us love me. Well, maybe it's, uh, I think 75% love me."
1393.119,0.62,But
1394.64,2.78,I actually know I did think about that and
1398.18,5.35,"our country is, uh doing very badly with respect to its open borders and inflation,"
1403.54,0.949,crushing
1405.15,2.11,things happening in the Middle East and
1407.41,3.63,"Ukraine, it's so sad to see what's happening in Ukraine. Wow."
1411.52,1.599,I had a lot of people from
1413.229,2.411,"very religious people come up to me tonight,"
1415.839,1.421,from Ukraine and they're
1417.609,3.51,"asking me for help. So, so sad to see so many people"
1421.55,2.58,have been killed in Ukraine and we're going to get it.
1424.52,1.23,We're gonna get it settled up.
1425.76,3.689,"If we win as I'm president-elect, I'm going to get that done."
1429.459,3.14,I'm gonna do it before we ever get back. We have to get it stopped.
1433.489,4.33,"Too much killing, it's killing and all of those cities are coming, crashing down."
1437.829,1.821,Those beautiful golden domes
1440.29,2.35,are crashing down on their sides. They are
1443.06,3.799,so sad to see the whole thing is so sad. So we're going to be for all those people.
1446.869,2.171,"There are so many people came up to the day I said, uh"
1449.469,4.041,"religious people from Ukraine and I'm going to say, and I told them."
1453.52,2.89,"Don't worry, we're going to get it stopped. It's too bad. It ever started."
1456.64,2.549,It should have never started. It wouldn't have started.
1460.02,1.169,"But, uh,"
1461.719,1.99,we're gonna have our country respected again.
1463.719,2.36,We're gonna make sure that it's respected and we're gonna go out
1466.089,3.191,and do very good things for ourselves as a country and for
1469.93,0.779,the world.
1471.3,2.23,These are challenging times for our
1474.04,1.529,beautiful USA.
1476.06,2.33,But I'm committed to working with every partner
1478.4,2.39,here in New York and all across the nation
1481.109,2.661,to build an America that once again is strong
1483.78,3.51,and safe and proud and prosperous and free.
1487.3,0.929,I'm gonna make sure
1488.78,3.209,together we can create a future defined by great
1492.339,2.671,ambitions and grand achievements that once again
1495.02,2.4,"inspires the dreams of our Children,"
1497.43,1.46,brings back the American dream.
1498.9,2.26,You don't hear about the American dream anymore. We're gonna
1502.15,3.219,make it possible for them to have the American dream.
1506.089,3.301,"This is a very religious evening to me, it really is. It"
1509.859,2.051,"represents so much my,"
1512.54,2.6,my sister was uh somebody that
1515.31,3.419,loved the church and gave to the church. The cardinal knew that
1519.199,2.87,"had a certain priest that she thought was incredible, right?"
1522.199,3.74,"For certain, very, very fine man that she thought was incredible."
1526.619,1.011,Having a
1528.479,4.96,"recently myself survived two assassination attempts, they survived."
1534.14,1.52,Uh I have a
1535.91,1.6,chart that went down to the right.
1537.52,2.76,"Fortunately, I looked at my all time favorite piece of paper,"
1541.0,4.17,"but it went down and I looked to the right and I said, you know, was that luck?"
1545.599,2.47,What was that luck or was that God that did that?
1548.079,2.461,And I think it was God that did that I do.
1552.719,4.331,But I have a very fresh cardinal. I have a very fresh appreciation for
1557.439,3.63,how blessed we are by God's Providence and his divine mercy.
1561.079,2.551,"I mean, that was something I was not supposed to be here"
1564.17,1.939,tonight that I can tell you.
1566.479,2.46,"So with God's help, I know there is uh"
1569.239,0.811,nothing
1570.209,1.27,that cannot be achieved.
1571.489,3.96,We can achieve so much good with this country and get together and unify.
1576.079,3.671,I wanna thank the Al Smith Foundation for its noble work. And
1580.109,3.48,I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the
1584.41,2.72,Catholic community. It's a great community. It's a community.
1587.14,2.929,"I've gotten along with all my life. I tell you when I was,"
1590.63,2.18,"when I was president, I was in the"
1593.42,2.25,oval office and I got a call from the Cardinal
1596.64,1.66,and he said we need help. It was
1599.15,3.299,during the China virus. I want to be accurate when I describe it
1603.5,2.949,and he said we need help. Our schools are
1607.089,2.091,in devastating shape. They needed
1609.93,1.13,much more than a billion.
1611.069,3.15,I won't even tell you the number but much more than a billion dollars.
1614.469,3.681,"But I've known the community and I've known that the schools, I knew,"
1618.16,3.39,I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system
1622.369,2.541,and they are great and they just speak with it like with
1624.92,3.51,love much more so than almost any system that I've seen.
1629.069,1.5,"And he said, sir, we have"
1631.359,1.6,a big problem. We need
1633.869,2.24,a number of billions of dollars
1636.339,2.73,"or we're gonna have to close down the New York school system,"
1639.079,1.27,the whole system in New York.
1641.53,3.339,"And I said, give me 15 minutes. I think I can find it."
1645.31,2.889,"And we gave him billions of dollars and you know what,"
1648.209,2.0,he stayed open and they thrived.
1650.219,0.37,And
1650.75,1.709,to this day I hear you did
1652.709,2.671,just about the best job there is in education.
1655.959,0.671,"So,"
1657.93,1.429,and that was always an honor.
1659.55,0.75,That was always.
1660.79,2.61,"And every time he sees me, he says, thank you very much."
1663.41,1.9,"I said, I know what you're talking about. But"
1665.51,2.069,"we worked together. We were a good partnership, right?"
1667.589,5.671,We got that money in about 15 minutes. Billions. And uh it was put to very good use.
1673.27,3.089,But I just want to thank everybody. This is a special evening.
1676.709,3.87,It's a very serious evening. I think we have
1680.969,1.98,"some serious problems in the world,"
1683.18,3.09,but they're gonna get solved and we're gonna make America great again.
1686.28,3.699,And thank you very much and God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much.
